# Survey-Form

This is the first paert of the project, where a link to a survey is sent out to graduates. Each link is unique as it is generated with a unique graduate id. Once the form is filled in the submit button makes a POST request and ships the data to the database. This data is then queried and representated meaningfully in the form of graphs and charts with additional filters applied based on cohort, employer, length of service atc.
